Hello and welcome to one minute book review.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.256  align:left  
The show that brings <b>books</b> to life. I'm your host Vaughn Abdi.

00:05.256 --> 00:10.754  align:left  
I'll be reviewing Sapinens a brief history of human kind by Yuval Noah Harari

00:10.755 --> 00:12.809  align:left  
This book is a brief history into our development as humans.

00:12.809 --> 00:17.473  align:left  
from the plains of Africa to our current state in the animal kingdom

00:17.473 --> 00:19.500  align:left  
It analyzes some of the steps we took to get here 

00:19.500 --> 00:22.502  align:left  
and the challanges we faced along the way

00:22.502 --> 00:25.985  align:left  
The book highlights the impact that the agricultural revolution

00:26.100 --> 00:29.814  align:left  
and industrial revolution had on technology, business and population growth

00:29.814 --> 00:34.902  align:left  
It gives the reader an indication of our past was also briefly telling

00:34.902 --> 00:36.821  align:left  
what the future may hold for us

00:36.821 --> 00:39.850  align:left  
I enjoyed reading this book because it gave context of how

00:39.850 --> 00:41.990  align:left  
we had grown exponentially as humans

00:41.990 --> 00:44.141  align:left  
over the past couple of hundred of years and

00:44.225 --> 00:46.717  align:left  
and given the current trend, how we will continue to do so

00:46.716 --> 00:49.942  align:left  
The disclaimer in this book is that it refutes the idea of creationism

00:49.942 --> 00:52.378  align:left  
not really analyzing his impact

00:52.378 --> 00:54.792  align:left  
but if you take it on the merit of the book alone

00:54.800 --> 00:56.543  align:left  
I rate this book four stars

00:56.543 --> 00:58.716  align:left  
This is the one minute book review

00:58.716 --> 01:00.000  align:left  
Thanks for listening
